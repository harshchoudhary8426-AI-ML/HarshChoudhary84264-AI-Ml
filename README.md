# Student Performance Prediction 📊

This project uses Machine Learning to predict student exam performance based on different features such as study hours, previous scores, and other attributes.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for plots)

## 📂 Dataset

Use a CSV file like `students.csv` with columns such as:

- `hours_studied`
- `previous_score`
- `attendance`
- `gender`
- `parent_education`
- `final_score` (target)

You can download any student performance dataset from Kaggle or create your own small CSV.

## 🚀 Steps

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
